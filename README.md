Currently the timetable of the course of study for 'Computer Science and Digital Com-
munications' is still being set up manually without any tool support.
Consider the following:
Every student is assigned a group and each of those groups has an individual timetable
that needs to be consistent in itself. Some lecture courses should benished earlier
within a semester than others, meaning a time window has to be considered for every
course when setting up the timetable for a specific year group.
Moreover, there might a predefined sequence of lectures and exercises for a course, some
lecturers might only be available on certain days of the week, different courses taking
place on the same day should all be either online or on-site, students might want that
exams are well spread over time to balance work load, ... etc.
Having a look at the vast number of constraints that have to be considered in setting
up the timetable one can easily imagine that this is a time-consuming and tedious task
when done without any tool support. Therefore, a software support should be developed
that allows an efficient way to set up consistent timetables for each group.
